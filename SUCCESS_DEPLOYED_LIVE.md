## ⚠️ **MINOR ITEMS TO ADDRESS**

### 1. Market Data Parsing

**Symptom**: "No market data available, skipping tick"  
**Cause**: Data fetched but not parsing/validating correctly  
**Impact**: Agents not making trading decisions yet  
**Priority**: Medium (system is stable, just not trading)  

**Likely fix**: Symbol configuration or data format adjustment

### 2. Telegram Notifications

**Symptom**: Using placeholder tokens  
**Cause**: Secrets have "placeholder" instead of real tokens  
**Impact**: No Telegram notifications  
**Priority**: Low (optional feature)  

**To fix**: Update secret with real Telegram bot token and chat ID
