# ✅ CREDENTIALS CONFIGURED - SUMMARY

## What We've Done

1. ✅ **IPs Whitelisted in Aster API**
   - 35.188.43.171
   - 104.154.90.215
   - 34.9.133.10

2. ✅ **Updated Google Secret Manager**
   - ASTER_API_KEY: version 2 created
   - ASTER_SECRET_KEY: version 2 created

3. ✅ **Updated Kubernetes Secret**
   - cloud-trader-secrets updated with new keys
   - Applied to trading namespace

4. ✅ **Agents Enabled**
   - 6 agents available
   - 6 agents enabled
   - Configuration: $100 per bot

5. ✅ **Build Succeeded**
   - Latest deployment successful
   - Pods running
   - Health checks passing

## Current Status

**Service is running** but still showing "API credentials not configured".

This means the **secret needs to be properly synced** from Google Secret Manager to the Kubernetes secret.

## Solution

The secret-gcp-sync template should handle this. Let me verify it's working and trigger a final build that will properly mount the credentials.

**Next**: Submit build that will sync secrets from GCP Secret Manager into the pods properly.
