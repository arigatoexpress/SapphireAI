# Sapphire AI: Competition Launch Plan

## 🎯 Mission: Ship a Winning Demo

This rollout plan ensures Sapphire AI arrives at demo day as a polished, production-ready trading platform that clearly demonstrates superiority over typical hackathon/demo projects.

## 🏆 Competitive Advantages Ready for Demo

### Solo-Built Narrative
- **One Engineer**: Complete platform built by individual brilliance, not team bureaucracy
- **Rapid Iteration**: Features shipped in hours, not months
- **Focused Execution**: Every component serves the trading mission

### Production Excellence
- **Real Trading**: Live execution on Aster DEX (not paper trading demos)
- **Enterprise Security**: Institutional-grade auth, monitoring, and risk controls
- **Scalable Architecture**: GCP-native with Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, and Vertex AI

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

- ✅ **Code Quality**: Zero critical linter errors, comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **Security**: Admin API tokens, rate limiting, input validation, dependency audits
- ✅ **Performance**: <100ms trade latency, <10s startup, <600MB memory
- ✅ **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, Cloud Monitoring alerts, structured logging
- ✅ **Testing**: End-to-end flows, circuit breaker behavior, position verification
- ⏳ **Domain**: `sapphiretrade.xyz` DNS delegation for SSL certificate activation
- ⏳ **Network**: Cloud Run ingress lockdown to production origins

## 2. Environments
- **Staging (current Cloud Run services)** – latest code deployed via `deploy_cloud_run.sh`
- **Production** – same services promoted once DNS + SSL validated; use identical images for parity

## 3. Deployment sequence
1. Confirm `sapphiretrade-cert` status is `ACTIVE`; update Cloud Run ingress to `internal-and-cloud-load-balancing`.
2. Redeploy `cloud-trader` and `wallet-orchestrator` with latest container digests (`deploy_cloud_run.sh`).
3. Run smoke tests:
   - `curl -I https://trader.sapphiretrade.xyz`
   - `curl https://api.sapphiretrade.xyz/orchestrator/health`
   - `npm run test:e2e` against LB hostname.
4. Verify MCP websocket connectivity from dashboard (live council feed).
5. Update Aster API IP whitelist with `34.117.165.111`.

## 4. Monitoring & alerting
- Enable Cloud Monitoring uptime checks for both hostnames.
- Track Prometheus dashboard for latency, error rates, and MCP throughput.
- Configure log-based alerts for `ERROR` severity entries and Aster API 4xx/5xx spikes.

## 5. Rollback strategy
- Maintain previous container revisions (Cloud Run keeps last 100) – `gcloud run services update-traffic --to-revisions=REV=100` to revert.
- For infra rollback: detach `sapphiretrade-cert` and reattach `aster-cert` + revert DNS to prior zone if required.
- Keep `.env` snapshots and secret versions to restore earlier credentials.

## 6. Post-launch
- Hold 24h hypercare with increased logging retention.
- Schedule key rotation (Aster, Firebase, Telegram) within first week.
- Publish public roadmap & security summary to community to reinforce transparency.
