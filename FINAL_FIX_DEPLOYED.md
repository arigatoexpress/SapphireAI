# 🎊 CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED - BOTS WILL START TRADING!
## November 22, 2025 00:40 UTC

---

## ✅ **ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED**

### The Problem
```python
# OLD (broken):
symbols: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)  # Empty list!

# When code checks:
if symbol.upper() not in self._settings.symbols:
    continue  # Skips ALL tickers because list is empty

# Result: "No market data available"
```

### The Fix
```python
# NEW (working):
symbols: List[str] = Field(
    default_factory=lambda: ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "BNBUSDT", "SOLUSDT", "XRPUSDT"]
)

# Now tickers for these 5 symbols will be processed
# Agents can start trading!
```
