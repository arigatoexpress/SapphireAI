## ✅ **YOUR BOTS ARE LIVE AND RUNNING!**

### System Status

```
✅ Pod: Running (1/1 Ready)
✅ Agents: 6 initialized
✅ Trading Loop: Active (every 10 seconds)
✅ Aster DEX: Connected (fetching 237 tickers)
✅ Health: PASSING
✅ Credentials: Working
```

---

## 📊 **WHAT'S HAPPENING**

### Trading Loop Activity

The system is actively running:

```
[INFO] ✅ 6 agents initialized
[INFO] Trading loop active
[INFO] Calling _tick() every 10 seconds
[INFO] GET https://fapi.asterdex.com/fapi/v1/ticker/24hr "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[INFO] Fetched 237 tickers in 0.33s ✅
[WARNING] No market data available, skipping tick
[INFO] Sleeping for 10 seconds...
```

**Agents are initialized but waiting for properly formatted market data to start trading.**

---

## ⚠️ **WHY NO TELEGRAM UPDATES**

Telegram is using placeholder tokens:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=placeholder
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=placeholder
```

**Solution**: This is OK for now - system works without Telegram. When you want notifications:

1. Get your Telegram bot token
2. Get your chat ID
3. Update the secret:
```bash
kubectl patch secret cloud-trader-secrets -n trading \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/data/TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN","value":"YOUR_BASE64_TOKEN"}]'
```

Or disable Telegram notifications and just monitor via logs/dashboard.

## 📈 **MARKET DATA ISSUE**

**Symptoms:**
- Successfully fetching 237 tickers from Aster ✅
- But "No market data available" warning
- Skipping trading ticks

**Likely Causes:**
1. Market data parsing expects different format
2. Symbol list might be empty
3. Data validation rejecting tickers

**Impact:** Agents are ready but not trading yet

**To Fix:** Need to debug the market data parsing logic
